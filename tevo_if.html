        <b>Tevito</b>, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA" target="_blank">/teˈvitʊ/</a>), also known as <b>Tevo</b> and by the online aliases <b>estevoplz</b>, <b>deftevos</b>, <b>Tamagothic</b> and birth name  <b>Estêvão</b>, is a
        literary maniac, failed oil painter, vegetarian (since childhood),  film critic, and
        (most recently) wannabe renowned academic. This is the best description of most
        <a href="">unsufferable 19-year-olds</a>, but i accept my fate. I would consider myself mostly a humanities person but i also burn with passion for logic, mathematics and coding. I recently moved to Brazil's biggest urban hellscape to study linguistics at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo">USP</a>. I'm always interested in learning the most about pretty much anything. Some
        specific topics i like include: all the seven
        arts, some videogames, epigraphy, ancient greek, tea, 70s british folk
        revival in music, cultural studies, semiotics, Ireland and some more stuff. You can check the interests tab or this
